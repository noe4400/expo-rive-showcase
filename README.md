# 🎨 Rive Showcase with Expo

This project is a **Rive animation showcase** built with **Expo**.  
All animations are created using the [Rive Editor](https://rive.app) and are inspired by **Figma community designs**.  
The goal is to explore how interactive and performant vector animations can be integrated into a **React Native (Expo)** project

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React Native (Expo)** – cross-platform framework for iOS and Android
- **Rive React Native package** – to load and control `.riv` animations
- **Figma** – design references and UI inspiration
- **Rive Editor** – to design, animate, and export `.riv` files
